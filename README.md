# ml_for_3body

This project is launched by a big fan of *The Three-body Problem* written by LiuCixin, welcome other guys (or say, turkey researchers) join in!

The conventional solver can refer to [here](https://github.com/zaman13/Three-Body-Problem-Gravitational-System/blob/master/Python%20notebook%20files/Earth_Jupiter_Sun_system.ipynb). It can also easily be solved with Mathematica.

For more vivid explanation, please see [this article](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/588949798)

Our goal is to find stable solutions as much as possible, like what Prof. 廖世俊 did [here](https://news.sjtu.edu.cn/jdzh/20220606/172074.html)
